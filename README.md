# LawyerGPT – Indian Constitution AI Assistant 

## Overview
LawyerGPT is an AI-powered legal assistant that answers questions by **retrieving and referencing the Indian Constitution** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system indexes the full Constitution PDF, performs semantic search on relevant articles, and generates accurate, context-aware legal answers.

This ensures responses are **grounded in real constitutional text**, not hallucinated.
